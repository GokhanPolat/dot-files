Stole Python package ideas from [[https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python][Gabriel Elanaro's git project]].  The
question is whether I use [[http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropemacs.html][Rope]] or [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi][Jedi]] for auto-completion.  Rope,
while claiming more features, seems to crash and lock up my Emacs
connections, so I'm back to using Jedi...for now. See [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2013/01/10/jedi-completion-library-python/][this article]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (packages-install '( elpy
                       nose
                       jedi
                       py-autopep8          ;; pylint
                       virtualenvwrapper))
#+END_SRC

* Virtual Environments

  All development for Python is done in [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/][virtual environments]].
  However, this is a monstrous collection of layers.

  Assuming we have installed both [[http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html][virtualenvwrapper]] and [[https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv][autoenv]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv pyenv-virtualwrapper autoenv
    sudo pip install virtualenv   # installed globally
  #+END_SRC

  And use them by adding the following to our [[file:profile.org::*Python][.profile]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    export WORKON_HOME="$HOME/.virtualenvs"
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    source /usr/local/opt/autoenv/activate.sh
  #+END_SRC

  For a given /project/, we first install a particular Python version
  for it using the =pyenv= command (which must be done prior to
  starting a new virtual environment with the =mkvirtualenv= command):

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pyenv install 2.6.6    # pyenv versions to see what is installed
  #+END_SRC

  Get path to this built/installed executable:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pyenv local 2.6.6
    pyenv which python
  #+END_SRC

  Each project (environment) will be *named*, and the version of
  Python can be specified based on the results of the =pyenv which=
  command above, for instance:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mkvirtualenv -p /Users/howard.abrams/.pyenv/versions/2.6.6/bin/python lab
  #+END_SRC

  And to use the environment in a shell, issue:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    workon lab
  #+END_SRC

  Or, create an =.env= at the top of the project:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    echo 'workon lab' > .env
  #+END_SRC

  Now, commands like =pip= should be isolated to that virtual environment
  as well as the needed version.

  The [[http://elpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html#virtual-envs][Elpy Project]] deals with the =virtualenvwrapper=, so call
  function, =M-x pyvenv-workon=, to activate a virtual environment.

  *Note:* To restart the inferior Python processes automatically when
  switching virtual environments, add =pyvenv-restart-python= to
  =pyvenv-post-activate-hooks=.

* Basics

  WSGI files are just Python files in disguise, so tell them to use
  the Python environment:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.wsgi$" . python-mode))
  #+END_SRC

  Careful with the tabs, my friend.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
    (setq-default tab-width 4)

    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook '(lambda () (setq python-indent 4)))
  #+END_SRC

  Need to color the defined variables:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'color-identifiers-mode)
  #+END_SRC

* Prettify

  That =self= business in Python is quite distracting.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (when (fboundp 'global-prettify-symbols-mode)
      (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
                (lambda ()
                  (push '("self" . ?â—Ž) prettify-symbols-alist)
                  (modify-syntax-entry ?. "."))))
  #+END_SRC

* ELPY

  According to the [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/wiki][ELPY Web Site]], we first install the python-based
  package components:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install jedi

    # flake8 for code checks ... which installs pep8
    pip install flake8

    # and importmagic for automatic imports
    pip install importmagic

    pip install elpy
  #+END_SRC

  Once this has been installed, we can enable it:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (when (require 'elpy nil t)
    (elpy-enable))
  #+END_SRC

* Lint

  Let's try out the Pysmell project, which depends on Pymacs:
  sudo pip install Pymacs

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
    (when (require 'pymacs nil t)
      (when (require 'pysmell nil t)
        (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () (pysmell-mode 1)))))
  #+END_SRC

  My company has standardized on the =autopep8= project, just make sure you've
  install the library:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    workon wpc # Or whatever the project name is
    pip install --upgrade autopep8
  #+END_SRC

  And then we can use it, as long as =workon= command is set to the
  same virtual environment.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'py-autopep8 nil t)
  #+END_SRC

  Not sure I want to automatically change my files on save...you know,
  in case, I'm editing someone else's file. But this does seem like a
  good idea:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'py-autopep8-before-save)
  #+END_SRC

* Nose

  Unit test and code coverage tool for Python now comes to Emacs
  with [[http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html][Python Nose]].

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'nose nil t)
  #+END_SRC

* Jedi

  Auto-completion system for Python. This code hooks Jedi into the
  standard Python mode. See [[http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/][these instructions]] for details (but this
  should have been installed for Elpy).

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install jedi
  #+END_SRC

  New keys:

    - =C-Tab= for auto complete.
    - =C-.= to jump to definition (overrides the =ctags= interface)
    - =C-c d= to show the function documentation

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (when (require 'jedi nil t)
          (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)
          (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:ac-setup)
          (setq jedi:setup-keys t)
          (setq jedi:complete-on-dot t))
  #+END_SRC

* Rope

  Rope seems to be a helluva lot of work compare to Jedi...especially
  since the Rope instance dies and leaves the communication port
  open. Pretty annoying, so I will just be using Jedi for the time
  being, but will leave these instructions around for a wee bit.

  After installing the following Python libraries using =pip= (in a
  global environment):

    - [[http://rope.sourceforge.net/index.html][Rope]]
    - [[http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropemacs.html][Ropemacs]]
    - [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ropemode][Ropemode]]

  And have installed [[http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs.html][pymacs]], with both =package-install= as well as
  by cloning [[https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs.git][this Git repo]] and issuing a =make install=.
  According to [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2855378/ropemacs-usage-tutorial][this discusssion]], we /just/ need to:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
    (autoload 'pymacs-apply "pymacs")
    (autoload 'pymacs-call "pymacs")
    (autoload 'pymacs-eval "pymacs" nil t)
    (autoload 'pymacs-exec "pymacs" nil t)
    (autoload 'pymacs-load "pymacs" nil t)
    (autoload 'pymacs-autoload "pymacs")

    ;;(eval-after-load "pymacs"
    ;;  '(add-to-list 'pymacs-load-path YOUR-PYMACS-DIRECTORY"))

    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (pymacs-load "ropemacs" "rope-")
                (setq ropemacs-enable-autoimport t)))

    (defun rope-before-save-actions ()
      ;; Does nothing but save us from an error.
      )
    (defun rope-after-save-actions ()
      ;; Does nothing but save us from an error.
      )
    (defun rope-exiting-actions ()
      ;; Does nothing but save us from an error.
      )
  #+END_SRC

* IPython

  Got iPython and EIN? Great! Remember, pre-install (with =pip=) the
  following packages:

   - websocket
   - request
   - ein

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
     (when (require 'ein nil t)
       (setq ein:use-auto-complete t))
   #+END_SRC

   After starting the IPython notebook server,
   type =M-x ein:notebooklist-open= to open notebook list.

* Technical Artifacts

  Make sure that we can simply =require= this library.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (provide 'init-python)
  #+END_SRC

  Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put
  the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: =C-c C-c=
