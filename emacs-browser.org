I like the =w3m= browsing experience well enough, and reading
technical pages in Emacs is a good workflow. Except that I need to
hide lots of useless text for various web pages.

* Supporting Packages

  Not sure if I want to use the =w3m= or the 24.4-specific =eww=, so
  now I bounce between them. Which ever one I use, I do like these
  packages:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (packages-install '( ace-link ))
  #+END_SRC

  To use w3m, make sure it is installed:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  brew install w3m
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* EWW?

  For v24.4, I'm intrigued with EWW, but [[http://w3m.sourceforge.net][w3m]] works really well.
  The one I use is the one I've loaded ...

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (when (fboundp 'eww)
        (setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)

        (defun eww-search (term)
          (interactive "sSearch terms: ")
          (eww-browse-url (concat "http://www.google.com/search?gbv=1&source=hp&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&q=" term)))

        (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "G") 'eww)
        (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "b") 'eww-follow-link)
        (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "S") 'eww-search))
  #+END_SRC

* W3M?

  The following set up functions from [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m][emacs-w3m]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (when (fboundp 'w3m)
      (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
      (setq w3m-use-cookies t)
      (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "G") 'w3m-goto-url)
      (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "b") 'browse-url-at-point)
      (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "S") 'w3m-search))
  #+END_SRC

  While browsing, remember the following:

    - TAB to jump from link to link.
    - RETURN to follow a link
    - SPACE to move down the page
    - b to move up the page
    - B to move back in the history
    - M to open the URL in Firefox
    - I to open the image if it didn't show up correctly
    - c to copy the URL of the current page in the kill ring.
    - u to copy the URL of the link in the kill ring.
    - a to bookmark this page
    - v to look at the bookmarks
    - s to look through the page history for this session.

* External Web Browsing

  Sometimes the URL needs to be in Firefox, et. al:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook 'w3m-mode
              (lambda ()
                (define-key w3m-mode-map (kbd "x")
                  'w3m-view-url-with-external-browser)))
  #+END_SRC

  Most of the time, I would like to use built-in Emacs browser, but
  not always, so maybe I could have a function that switches between
  the browser options?

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (defun ha-switch-default-browser ()
      "Switches the default browser between the internal and external web browser."
      (interactive)
      ;;         | Variable                  | Function
      (if (equal browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-default-browser)
          (if (fboundp 'w3m)
              (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
            (setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url))
        (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-default-browser))

      ;; Now we need to display the current setting. The variables are
      ;; pretty typical and have the goodies, but I just need to get rid
      ;; of the word "url" or "browser", and the results are pretty close:
      (message "Browser set to: %s"
               (car
                (filter (lambda (x)
                          (if (or (equal "url" x)
                                  (equal "browse" x)
                                  (equal "browser" x))
                              nil
                            t))
                        (split-string (format "%s" browse-url-browser-function) "-")))))

    (define-key personal-global-map (kbd "w") 'ha-switch-default-browser)
    #+END_SRC

* Web Page Cleanup

  Navigating some sites in a text browser is a bit painful, but we
  could have some functions that either move the cursor passed the
  header to the start of the content, or actually remove some of the
  content.

** Google Search

  Don’t need to actually remove stuff when search in Google, as I
  really just need to jump ahead and skip the header:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun w3m-skip-in-google ()
    "For a Google Search, skip to the first result."
    (beginning-of-buffer)
    (search-forward-regexp "[0-9, ]+ results")
    (forward-line 2)
    (recenter-top-bottom 0))
#+END_SRC

** Stack Overflow

   Without a clear enough label, searching for the start of content
   will always be fragile. We’ll look for the start of the first column.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun w3m-skip-in-stackoverflow ()
      (beginning-of-buffer)
      (search-forward-regexp "^   ")
      (forward-line -2)
      (recenter-top-bottom 0))
#+END_SRC

   Stack Overflow has a lot of text that isn’t helpful to someone in a
   text-based browser, so I would like to remove the voting and other
   parts. Not sure how to do it, since the columns are of variable width.

** ClojureDocs

   The [[http://clojuredocs.org/][clojuredocs.org]] website has a big header, but doesn’t include a
   link to jump to the content, so let’s try to figure that out for
   most function definitions:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (defun w3m-skip-in-clojuredocs()
       "When viewing the Clojuredocs, we can skip to the meat of the
     function description by looking for the label, ‘Available since’,
     and finding the function name just before that."
       (beginning-of-buffer)
       (search-forward-regexp "Available since")
       (forward-line -4)
       (recenter-top-bottom 0))
   #+END_SRC

** Web Site Dispatch Function

  Add a hook to the =w3m-display-functions= to match the URL to see
  which function we need to call:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (defun w3m-hide-stuff (url)
      "Call screen cleaning functions for the W3M based on the URL."
      (interactive)
      (cond ((string-match "google\.com/search" url) (w3m-skip-in-google))
            ((string-match "clojuredocs.org" url) (w3m-skip-in-clojuredocs))
            ((string-match "stackoverflow.com" url) (w3m-skip-in-stackoverflow))
            ))

    (add-hook 'w3m-display-functions 'w3m-hide-stuff)
  #+END_SRC

* Easier Link Selection

  [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link][Ace-Link]] already supports EWW, so I just need to add it to =w3m=.
  This turns it on everywhere:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (ace-link-setup-default)
  #+END_SRC

  And perhaps turn it on for w3m-mode:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (when (and (fboundp 'w3m) (require 'ace-link nil t))
      (add-hook 'w3m-mode
                (lambda ()
                  (define-key w3m-mode-map "o" 'ace-link-eww))))
  #+END_SRC

* Better Navigation

  Intrigued with [[http://oremacs.com/2014/12/30/ace-link-eww/][navigation extensions for EWW]] where the “j” and “k”
  keys move /by paragraphs/ if the point is at the beginning of the
  line. I’m adding that to both browser types:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (defun oww-down (arg)
      (interactive "p")
      (if (bolp)
          (progn
            (forward-paragraph arg)
            (forward-line 1))
        (line-move arg)))

    (defun oww-up (arg)
      (interactive "p")
      (if (bolp)
          (progn
            (forward-line -1)
            (backward-paragraph arg)
            (forward-line 1))
        (line-move (- arg))))

    (add-hook 'eww-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (define-key eww-mode-map "j" 'oww-down)
                (define-key eww-mode-map "k" 'oww-up)))

    (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (define-key w3m-mode-map "j" 'oww-down)
                (define-key w3m-mode-map "k" 'oww-up)))
  #+END_SRC

* EWW End of Images

  Don´t care, when I´m in Emacs, to bother with images:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq shr-blocked-images ".*")
  #+END_SRC

* Technical Artifacts

  Make sure that we can simply =require= this library.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (provide 'init-browser)
  #+END_SRC

  Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put
  the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: =C-c C-c=
